would you willingly make you life harder just to feel better about yourself? thats what i did. instead of forcing my dad to pay more gas prices to drive me to school he pays a slightly higher electrcity bill to charge my scooter. my escooter.  
  
why do i have an escooter? i mentioned it, like, once, and he got me it. like hello?? like thank u but isnt it like 600 dollars?? you couldve bought me like a gazillion switch games. or the switch 2. like literally dewd  
  
took like 2 weeks of practicing and driving into my familys trash can before deciding my dad should let me go to school alone with the scooter. YAY!!! but like why would i do this to myself? idk when you drive to school and see everyone talking about bike to school month it messes with your head.  
  
another thing i got is a drawing tablet. nothing too fancy, its a fifty dorrar wacom one. no screen, two buttons on the pen, and thats it. new experience and hard to get used to but eh im getting there. its actually kinda nice. when i drew with the touch screen stylus (whic broke) my eyes kinda hurt and it was hard to find a comfy position to hold the laptop in to draw. and how do i practice using the wacom?  
  
playing bloons td.  
  
now people that know me may be like "wtf? why did u randomly get a gift when its not your birthday which is 3 months away??" good question. its becaue he wants me to draw characters for him that are for an album cover, which eventually became a bunch of lore and stories. i thought this would be quick. no no no, he is SO nit picky about the designs and shit. can an artist express themselves with their art without it getting called south park?  
  
in other news, i finished a yuri!!!! Sekai de Ichiban Oppai ga Suki, or I love boobs the most in the world, is what the title depicts. 8 volumes of pure goodness. everyone needs a little spice in their books.  
  
no, im not lesbian for liking yuri. sorry for not wanting to see the same trope each FUCKING TIME
